# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements URL visit tracking functionality that maintains a counter of how many times each URL has been visited. This data will replace the existing click tracking logic and enhance the bookmark search functionality by including frequently visited URLs in search results, providing users with more relevant and personalized search experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to automatically track my URL visits so that frequently visited pages are prioritized in search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new web page is opened THEN the system SHALL increment the visit count for that URL in storage
2. WHEN a URL is visited for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new entry with count 1
3. WHEN a URL is visited again THEN the system SHALL increment the existing count by 1
4. WHEN storing visit data THEN the system SHALL use Chrome's storage API for persistence

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my search results to include frequently visited URLs alongside bookmarks so that I can quickly access pages I visit often.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL search both bookmarks and visited URLs
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL include URLs from the visit count table that match the search query
3. WHEN ranking search results THEN the system SHALL consider visit frequency as a ranking factor
4. WHEN a visited URL matches a bookmark THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate entries in search results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to remove the redundant click tracking logic since URL visits are now tracked automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bookmark is clicked THEN the system SHALL NOT record click data separately
2. WHEN a bookmark is opened THEN the system SHALL rely on the URL visit tracking instead
3. WHEN migrating from old system THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition
4. WHEN cleaning up code THEN the system SHALL remove obsolete click tracking logic from selection-manager.ts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the visit tracking data to be stored efficiently in Chrome local storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing visit data THEN the system SHALL use chrome.storage.local exclusively
2. WHEN chrome.storage.local is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the extension popup
3. WHEN accessing visit data THEN the system SHALL handle storage errors gracefully
4. WHEN storing URLs THEN the system SHALL normalize URLs to avoid duplicate entries for the same page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search functionality to provide relevant results based on my browsing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL weight results based on visit frequency
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show visit count information where appropriate
3. WHEN no bookmarks match THEN the system SHALL still show relevant visited URLs
4. WHEN search query is empty THEN the system SHALL show most frequently visited URLs as suggestions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when the extension encounters issues so I can understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message in a dedicated error block in the extension popup
2. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain an array of error messages
3. WHEN new errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL push error messages to the error array
4. WHEN storing error messages THEN the system SHALL save them in localStorage for persistence
5. WHEN the popup is initializing THEN the system SHALL clear all stored error messages from localStorage
6. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL show all current error messages in the popup UI
