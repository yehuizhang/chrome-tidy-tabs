# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing URL visit tracking system by initializing the visit database with historical browsing data from Chrome's history API on the extension's first run. Instead of starting with an empty visit database, the system will populate it with existing browsing patterns, providing immediate personalized search results based on the user's historical browsing behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to read my existing browse history on first installation, so that my search results are immediately personalized based on my past browsing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension runs for the first time THEN the system SHALL check if the visit database is empty
2. WHEN the visit database is empty THEN the system SHALL request access to Chrome's history API
3. WHEN history access is granted THEN the system SHALL read the user's browsing history
4. WHEN reading history THEN the system SHALL process each history item and populate the visit database
5. IF the visit database already contains data THEN the system SHALL skip the history initialization process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to request history permission only when needed, so that I understand why the permission is being requested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension needs to access history THEN the system SHALL request the "history" permission dynamically
2. WHEN requesting permission THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about why history access is needed
3. IF the user denies history permission THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with real-time visit tracking only
4. WHEN permission is granted THEN the system SHALL proceed with history initialization
5. WHEN permission is denied THEN the system SHALL store this preference to avoid repeated requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the history initialization to be efficient and not impact the extension's performance, so that my browsing experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading history THEN the system SHALL process history items in batches to avoid blocking the UI
2. WHEN processing large amounts of history THEN the system SHALL limit the number of history items processed (e.g., last 10,000 visits)
3. WHEN initializing from history THEN the system SHALL show progress feedback to the user
4. WHEN history processing is complete THEN the system SHALL mark the initialization as complete in storage
5. IF history processing fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue with real-time tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to populate the visit database with history data using the same format as the existing visit tracking system, so that search results work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing history items THEN the system SHALL normalize URLs using the same logic as the existing visit tracker
2. WHEN a URL appears multiple times in history THEN the system SHALL aggregate the visit counts
3. WHEN storing history data THEN the system SHALL replace any existing visit data with the history-derived counts
4. WHEN storing aggregated data THEN the system SHALL use the same storage format as the existing visit tracking system
5. WHEN history initialization is complete THEN the system SHALL seamlessly integrate with ongoing real-time visit tracking
