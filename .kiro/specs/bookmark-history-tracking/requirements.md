# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing bookmark search functionality by adding history tracking capabilities. The system will record when users click on bookmarks from the extension and use this click count data to influence search result rankings. This creates a personalized search experience where frequently accessed bookmarks appear higher in search results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to track how many times I click on each bookmark, so that my frequently used bookmarks appear higher in search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a bookmark from the search results THEN the system SHALL increment the click count for that bookmark URL
2. WHEN a user clicks on a bookmark from the search results THEN the system SHALL store the updated click count in Chrome storage
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve existing click count data from Chrome storage
4. IF a bookmark has no previous click history THEN the system SHALL initialize its click count to 0

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want search results to be ranked by both relevance and my usage history, so that I can quickly find the bookmarks I use most often.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a fuzzy search THEN the system SHALL combine the fuzzy search score with the click count data
2. WHEN calculating final search rankings THEN the system SHALL weight click counts to boost frequently used bookmarks
3. WHEN two bookmarks have similar fuzzy search scores THEN the system SHALL rank the bookmark with higher click count first
4. WHEN a bookmark has never been clicked THEN the system SHALL still include it in search results based on fuzzy search score alone

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the click tracking to work seamlessly without affecting the extension's performance, so that my search experience remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing click count data THEN the system SHALL use Chrome storage API efficiently without blocking the UI
2. WHEN loading click count data THEN the system SHALL handle storage errors gracefully without breaking search functionality
3. WHEN the storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to fuzzy search only without displaying errors
4. WHEN updating click counts THEN the system SHALL perform the operation asynchronously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my click history to persist across browser sessions, so that my personalized search rankings are maintained over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL retain all previously stored click count data
2. WHEN the extension is disabled and re-enabled THEN the system SHALL preserve existing click history
3. WHEN Chrome storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue functioning
4. WHEN storing click data THEN the system SHALL use Chrome's sync storage to maintain data across devices (if user has sync enabled)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the click tracking to only count meaningful interactions, so that accidental clicks don't skew my search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a bookmark item THEN the system SHALL increment the count only once per click
2. WHEN a user hovers over a bookmark without clicking THEN the system SHALL NOT increment the click count
3. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation to select and open a bookmark THEN the system SHALL increment the click count
4. WHEN the same bookmark is opened multiple times in quick succession THEN the system SHALL count each distinct click event
