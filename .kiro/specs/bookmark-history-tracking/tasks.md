- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
  - Implement storage error recovery mechanisms
  - Add logging for debugging without exposing sensitive URLs
  - Ensure search continues working when storage fails
  - Test error scenarios and recovery paths
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Update TypeScript interfaces and types
  - Extend existing interfaces for enhanced search results
  - Add type definitions for click data structures
  - Update imports and exports across affected modules
  - Ensure type safety throughout the implementation
  - _Requirements: All requirements for type safety_

- [x] 8. Write comprehensive tests and validate implementation
