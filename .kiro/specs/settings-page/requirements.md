# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a settings page to the Tidy Tabs Chrome extension that allows users to configure extension behavior. The primary setting will be customizing the number of search results displayed in the bookmark search feature. The settings page will be accessible via a gear button added to the main popup interface next to the existing tab management buttons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access extension settings through a gear button in the main popup, so that I can easily configure the extension without navigating through Chrome's extension management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup is opened THEN the system SHALL display a gear button next to the existing tab management buttons (Sort, Remove Duplicates, Merge Windows)
2. WHEN the user clicks the gear button THEN the system SHALL navigate to a settings page within the extension popup
3. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a clear way to return to the main popup interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the number of search results displayed in bookmark search, so that I can optimize the interface for my browsing habits and screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page is opened THEN the system SHALL display a setting for "Number of search results to show"
2. WHEN the user modifies the search results count THEN the system SHALL validate the input is a positive integer between 1 and 100
3. WHEN the user saves the setting THEN the system SHALL persist the value using Chrome's storage API
4. WHEN the user performs a bookmark search THEN the system SHALL limit results to the configured number
5. IF no custom setting is configured THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 10 search results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings to be saved automatically and persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure the extension every time I restart my browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes a setting value THEN the system SHALL automatically save the change to Chrome's sync storage
2. WHEN the extension is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve saved settings from Chrome's sync storage
3. WHEN settings cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL use default values and continue functioning normally
4. WHEN the user has multiple Chrome instances THEN the system SHALL sync settings across all instances

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings page to have a clean, consistent interface that matches the extension's existing design, so that the experience feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same CSS styling and color scheme as the main popup
2. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL have a clear title indicating it's the settings page
3. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels and descriptions for each setting
4. WHEN the user interacts with settings controls THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for changes
5. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a "Back" or "Done" button to return to the main interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset settings to their default values if needed, so that I can easily recover from configuration mistakes or start fresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Reset to Defaults" button or link
2. WHEN the user clicks "Reset to Defaults" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN the user confirms the reset THEN the system SHALL restore all settings to their default values
4. WHEN settings are reset THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the default values immediately
5. WHEN settings are reset THEN the system SHALL save the default values to storage
