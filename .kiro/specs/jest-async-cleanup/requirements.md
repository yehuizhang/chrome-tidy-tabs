# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Jest test suite is experiencing "Cannot log after tests are done" errors due to asynchronous operations (specifically setTimeout callbacks) continuing to execute after test completion. This occurs in the ClickTracker class where async storage operations use setTimeout for non-blocking UI behavior, but these timers continue running after Jest tests finish, causing console.error calls that Jest flags as problematic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want all asynchronous operations to be properly cleaned up when tests complete, so that I don't get "Cannot log after tests are done" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test completes THEN all setTimeout callbacks SHALL be cleared or completed
2. WHEN test mode is enabled THEN async operations SHALL execute synchronously without setTimeout
3. WHEN tests run THEN no console logging SHALL occur after test completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ClickTracker to behave differently in test mode versus production mode, so that tests run predictably while production code remains non-blocking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testMode is enabled THEN saveClickDataAsync SHALL not use setTimeout
2. WHEN testMode is disabled THEN saveClickDataAsync SHALL use setTimeout for non-blocking behavior
3. WHEN in test mode THEN all async operations SHALL complete before method returns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Jest test cleanup, so that tests don't interfere with each other and don't leave hanging async operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each test completes THEN all timers SHALL be cleared
2. WHEN beforeEach runs THEN any existing timers SHALL be cleared
3. WHEN afterEach runs THEN all pending async operations SHALL be awaited or cleared

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling to respect test mode, so that error logging doesn't occur after tests complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in test mode THEN error logging SHALL be synchronous
2. WHEN an error occurs in production mode THEN error logging MAY be asynchronous
3. WHEN test mode is enabled THEN error callbacks SHALL not use setTimeout
